        <div>
        <p>In this section of Petsby, we're thrilled to introduce you to some of the sweetest dogs that have ever graced the world with their presence. These furry friends are more than just pets; they are heartwarming bundles of joy, each with their own unique personality, charm, and stories that will melt your heart.</p>

            <h2>Meet our sweet dogs</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Sage</h3>
                    <div class="section">
                        <img class="center" src="images/sage/sage_pet.jpeg" alt="Sage the dog" width="500">
                        <p>Sage is a 3 year old Golden Retriever. She is one of the laziest dogs. She loves sneaking into the bedroom and hopping onto the neatest bed. She also loves riding in a car with the windows open feeling the wind and air. She enjoys walking, only if you take her for a ride to a big arboretum or park. Walking around the neighborhood is not necessarily her cup of tea. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Her favorite food is corn. One day, she stole corn on the cob from the dining table, which was surprising because she is normally gentle and polite. She took the stolen corn to the patio and enjoyed her meal by herself. Unfortunately, the corn turned out to be unripe, so she ended up vomiting it all later.

                        <p>Cody is a 7yr old Pembroke Corgi. He was born in Cavalier Farms, Seattle. He prefers to spend his days lounging on the bean bag. Every day, he enjoys two walks around the neighborhood and likes to make friends with other doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the cyclist, but he is not allowed to give chase.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold weather. He would like to stay at home lounging by the fireplace in winter.
